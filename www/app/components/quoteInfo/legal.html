                    <h3>SUMMARY of COVERAGE LIMITATIONS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</h3>
                    <p style="white-space:normal;">SUMMARY of COVERAGE LIMITATIONS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This is a Summary of Coverage Limitations. This summary highlights some of the important limitations of your policy. You should review these coverage limitations carefully. NO COVERAGE FOR PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES. Punitive or exemplary damages may be assessed in a lawsuit in order to punish the wrongdoer or to make an example of the wrongdoer. This policy will not afford coverage for you in the event that you, or an uninsured/underinsured motorist, become liable for punitive or exemplary damages. NO COVERAGE FOR UNLISTED DRIVERS. All residents of your household, including unmarried children, wards, and foster children that are not emancipated, even if they regularly live elsewhere, must be specifically included at the time of your application for insurance, and named on the Declarations Page to be covered. You may choose to exclude some or all residents from coverage. Your failure to identify and insure these persons and name them on the Declarations Page, or specifically exclude them from coverage, will result in a denial of coverage. Your failure to provide complete and accurate information in the application process may be deemed to be fraud or misrepresentation and may result in a denial of coverage. NO COVERAGE FOR UNLISTED VEHICLES. There is no coverage under Part A (Liability) for your maintenance and use of a vehicle that is not listed on this policy which is owned by or regularly available for the use of you, a family member, or resident. This policy does not cover you while driving any car owned by or regularly available to a family member or resident of your home. If you wish to be covered on these additional vehicles, you must add them to this policy or purchase a separate policy. NO COVERAGE FOR DAMAGE TO RENTAL/SUBSTITUTE VEHICLES. There is no coverage under this policy for damage to vehicles for which you or any insured person may rent, use, or have care, custody, and control. This policy does not afford coverage for damage you or another insured person may cause to any rental or substitute vehicle. If you borrow or rent a vehicle and wish to be covered for damage that you may cause to that vehicle, you must purchase additional coverage. LICENSED PHYSICIANS ONLY. "Medical Services" has been defined in Part B (Medical Payments) to provide payment for those medical services provided by or under the supervision of a licensed physician. A â€œphysicianâ€ is an individual licensed by a State or territory of the United States or District of Columbia to practice medicine, practice surgery, and prescribe drugs. In a claim under Medical Payments, this policy will only pay those expenses incurred for medical services which are defined in Part B (Medical Payments). FOURTEEN (14) DAYS TO REPORT NEW OPERATOR(S) OR ADDITIONAL VEHICLE(S). If you or any listed driver acquires or becomes the principal user of any additional or replacement vehicle, and you want to cover that vehicle under this policy, you must tell us within 14 days of acquiring that vehicle. NO COVERAGE FOR ANY BUSINESS USE. This policy does not cover the ownership or any operation of a vehicle while it is used for business purposes, including the use of vehicles for sales/marketing, or for the delivery of newspapers, food, or any property for a fee. NO COVERAGE FOR CUSTOM PARTS OR EQUIPMENT. Coverage under Part D (Coverage for Damage to Your Auto) does not provide coverage for any furnishings, equipment, stereos, radios or other sound reproducing or video equipment, devices, accessories, enhancements, or changes that are not installed by the original manufacturer of the vehicle. NO COMPREHENSIVE/COLLISION COVERAGE OVER $45,000. Coverage under Part D (Coverage for Damage to Your Auto) is limited to a maximum of $45,000, regardless of the actual cash value of the vehicle at the time of loss. If you have a vehicle that has an actual cash value over $45,000, you will not be covered under this policy for the amount that exceeds the maximum limits in the event of a loss. LOSS DUE TO DIMINUTION OF VALUE. There is no coverage under Part D for diminution of value that may result from repairs caused by a covered loss. YOU AUTHORIZE AND CONSENT TO ACCESS OF YOUR EDR. If your vehicle has an Event Data Recorder (EDR), or other similar device, your purchase of this policy and acknowledgement below is your consent and authorization to us to retrieve information collected and stored on that device in connection with any claim made under this policy. IMPORTANT NOTICE AND CONSENT. You must notify us promptly if you move to another state or province. If your covered auto is no longer principally garaged in Alabama, or if you relocate and your covered auto is principally garaged outside of Alabama for more than 30 days, then your coverage will terminate. Your acceptance of this policy and your acknowledgement below serves as your notice to us of your consent and intent to terminate coverage when you or your covered auto is relocated outside of Alabama. By signing below you have given your consent and indicate your intent to terminate coverage under this policy effective the 31st day your covered auto is principally garaged outside of Alabama when you relocate to another state. I hereby acknowledge that I have reviewed the Summary of Coverage Limitations and Acknowledgement and accept this policy and its terms and conditions as the appropriate coverage option for my auto insurance needs.</p>
