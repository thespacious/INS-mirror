Data chunking for generics.
    i've got:
        >controller based generics that handle scoping per form generically
        >this means I must make call either for each for each json object on each page load
        >or get one absolutely way too big json object in the beginning (second call (after auth)) and pass each to an instance of a form controller class
        >but I like the pass each piece of data in chunks to classes expecting that chunk for each page
